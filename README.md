# DiscordBot
Various bots created for Discord

#### FFBEBot
This is the first discord bot I've created which began as an experimental project and has grown to be a lot larger. It is currently on 40+ discord servers including the offical reddit server for the game and sees regular usage on a daily basis. The bot is designed based on some of the bots created by the touchandswipe github account. The projects uses JDA as the main interface with discord, JSoup to help with parsing wiki pages, and the google drive API to store the data files. The bot is currently being run on the Heroku platform. 

#### Search
This the second bot created for a server that I am in and is built using much of the code from FFBEBot. It is custom built to fill some of the needs of a server I'm in, including some custom features.

#### Remote
This is a private bot created so I can remotely control my computer when I'm away for several days. It is a simple bot with commands to control some of the common computer functions, as well as planning actions in advance with its delay command
